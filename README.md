# 📌 Fluorescent Spore Counter - Getting Started

## 🔬 Overview
The **Fluorescent Spore Counter (FSA)** is a tool designed to analyze tetrad dissection outcomes using fluorescent markers in budding yeast. It facilitates efficient scoring of different recombination events based on color markers, allowing researchers to determine crossover frequencies and genetic distances.

## 📂 Repository Link
This repository hosts the code and documentation for the FSA tool: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ArrosanRajalingam/Fluorescent-Spore-Counter).

## 🧬 How It Works
FSA utilizes three fluorescent markers:
- **🟥 CEN8::RFP** (Red Fluorescent Protein at CEN8)
- **🟩 ARG4::GFP** (Green Fluorescent Protein at ARG4)
- **🟦 THR1::CFP** (Cyan Fluorescent Protein at THR1)

Based on the segregation patterns of these markers, different recombination events (single and double crossovers, non-parental ditypes, and meiosis I nondisjunction events) can be identified and categorized. Genetic distances are calculated using **Perkins' equation**:

$$cM = \frac{100 \times (6 \times NPD + TT)}{2 \times (PD + NPD + TT)}$$

## 📊 Tetrad Analysis Table
| **Tetrad Type** | **Marker Configuration** |
|---------------|------------------------|
| 🧬 Parental | RG, RG, B, B |
| 🔄 Single CO at CEN8-ARG4 | RG, RB, G, B |
| 🔄 Single CO at ARG4-THR1 | RGB, RG, B, E |
| 🔄 Double CO type i | RG, RB, GB, E |
| 🔄 Double CO type ii | RGB, RB, G, E |
| 🔄 Double CO type iii | RGB, R, G, B |
| 🔄 Double CO type iv | RG, R, GB, B |
| ❌ NPD at CEN8-ARG4 | RB, RB, G, G |
| ⚠️ MI NDJ | RGB, RGB, E, E |
